# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices:
I created this scheme with the thought in mind that the accent colors had to be greens that are high in chroma and brightness.
The second and third color are black and grey because I wanted the background to be those colors.
The first color is a more readable green.
this color scheme was inspired by a terminal on a computer.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices:
I chose a color scheme with different shades of green. All low in saturation.
This will give the site a very natural feel.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: 
I wanted the headline color and navigation bar color to be a blue that is high in chroma.
I also wanted the background to be white. While accents will be othe blues and grays.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Explanation of your color choices:
I wanted the pallete to be very playful.
That is why I chose colors that have a hight chroma.
I chose a gray accent color to be a neutral color.
